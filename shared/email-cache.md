## Conversation cache (every email skill)

Keep what you read from Brevo in this conversation and reuse it, instead of calling the same
tool again. The cache is your own notes in the conversation, never a file. Key every entry by
account **and** sub-account ID (none for the main account), and note when you fetched it
(`fetchedAt`). Never show or reuse an entry from another account or sub-account.

| What | Keep it | Fetch again when |
|---|---|---|
| Account (company, address, own email), senders, contact attributes | About 10 minutes | Time is up. An attribute in the email isn't in the cached list and the cache is more than about a minute old: fetch the attributes once more before reporting it (the user may have just added it). The user switches account or sub-account, or says they changed it in Brevo |
| Sender domains (whether each is authenticated) | Same as senders | Same as senders |
| Brand kit | The whole conversation (one read) | The user says they changed it in Brevo, or switches account. After this conversation's own save, update the cache with the approved values; don't read it back |
| Templates this conversation created or read | The whole conversation | The user says they edited it in Brevo's editor (fetch it before a preview or test). After this conversation's own update, apply the change to the cache |
| Lists and segments | Not cached | Fetch when needed |

- **A failed fetch never blocks.** Skip the check that needed it, say so in one line ("I
  couldn't read your contact attributes, so that check was skipped"), and go on.
- **Errors:** a 5xx is retried once, then the user is told it is on Brevo's side. A 404 on a
  cached template: drop it from the cache and tell the user it no longer exists. A 429 on
  the brand kit: keep the cached kit and say the hourly limit is reached.
- **"What do you have cached?"** List each entry (what, account, when fetched) without
  secrets. **"Refresh"** clears everything; fetch again as each step needs it.
- If you can't tell how much time has passed, fetch the 10-minute items again when the user
  starts a new email.
- Never keep API keys, tokens or passwords in the cache or anywhere in the conversation.

**Call budget** for a transactional template (write, check, save, preview, test): about 11
calls with the cache (account, senders, attributes, brand kit, save, 3 sample renders,
sender domains, test send, outcome) against about 16 without it (the account read 3 times,
attributes and senders twice, and the template read back). Each fix round that re-checks
attributes would add one more call without it.
