## Brevo connection rules

- Every Brevo call goes through the Brevo MCP server's tools. The user's connection carries
  their authentication (OAuth). **Never ask for an API key, never ask the user to paste a key
  into the chat, and never put a key in a file or command.**
- If a tool returns 401 or 403, ask the user to reconnect Brevo in their agent's settings.
- If a tool a step needs is missing from your tool list, stop that step and say that the
  user's Brevo connection doesn't offer it (connections can differ). Don't improvise with
  other tools. Writing HTML never needs a tool; offer it, and the steps to finish in Brevo.
- On a sub-account, pass `subaccount_id` on every call: every Brevo tool takes it per call,
  and a call without it acts on the main account.
- Show a tool's error message as returned, after a plain-language summary. Don't invent a
  cause the tool didn't give.
